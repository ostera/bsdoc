Additionally, to install the support files (default CSS and Javascript), you

yarn run v1.12.3
$ ./node_modules/.bin/bsdoc support-files

## Contributing

`bsdoc` is developed as a Native Reason project, and is only possible thanks to
`esy`, `dune`, and, naturally, `odoc`.

If you haven't installed Esy yet, follow the instructions in their web site:
https://esy.sh

After you have done that, you need only run `esy build` to get the project
bootstrapped.

## Installing on Linux/Windows

Unfortunately I haven't gotten around publishing `bsdoc` for Linux/Windows, but if you have `npm` installed you can run:

```sh
$ esy build
$ esy npm-release
```

And that'll get you an npm package that you can then install locally (or globally) in any of your projects. Be mindful that it'll only work for `bs-platform@6` projects!
